        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Tracy Musongole. I`m a software developer based in
          Zambia. My interest in software development started back in 2021 after
          I returned home from Russia(I studied in Moscow for a little while). I
          was amazed by how life can be made so much smoother with cutting edge
          technology right at your finger tips. I decided to give it a go and
          learn to develop software that would also make my life in Zambia much
          smoother.
          <br />
          Fast forward to now, I have already had the priveledge of working with
          a few local startups and built my own full fledged API`s websites and
          web-apps. I do take on freelance projects too, so if you got an idea
          you wanna bring to life, don`t hesitate to reach out.
